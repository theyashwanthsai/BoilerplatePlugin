# BoilerplatePlugin
Basic boilerplate for creating neovim plugin.

So I spent two days trying to figure out a way to create custom plugins.
A lot of blogs were helpful but then I realized I use 
Astrovim which uses Lazy.nvim. I felt like a noob but them after putting in some time, I finally figured it out.
I realized its way too different from the blogs I read. So here is a basic boilerplate to create your own 
plugins for neovim.
I will soon write a blog explaining this. I will also update this repo as I learn.
